        I am currently a preliminary medicine student at UC Riverside, majoring in psychology to broaden my understanding of human beings in general. This academic pursuit aims to enhance my skills as a future physician, enabling me to provide compassionate care to patients.  Additionally, I am the founder of several organizations, both affiliated with UCR and operating independently as NGOs. Some of these initiatives were established to align with my interest in medicine, particularly psychiatry. Moreover, one of the organizations was created to support first-generation students, like myself, in successfully navigating their career pathways in medicine and various healthcare fields.

          <b>A Daily Dose of Medicine</b><br><br>
          This company is dedicated to provide the audience with short and quick information about some of the exciting aspects of medicine and biomedical science in general through a notification app.  I led and directed a group of talented engineers through the final stages of building the app. Additionally, I plan to offer up to 70 internship positions to pre-health students who are interested in becoming our general editor interns. This initiative is designed to provide them with opportunities to gain valuable internship experiences.

These resources include a mini book series, free tutoring sessions for classes, workshops to find shadowing positions, and conferences aimed at enhancing understanding of the matriculation process for medical schools and preparing the application.
